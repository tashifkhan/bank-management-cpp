# Bank Management C++

## INTRODUCTION

Banking activities are considered to be the life blood of the national Economy. Without banking services, trading and business activities cannot be carried on smoothly. Banks are the distributors and protectors of liquid capital which is of vital significance to a developing country. Efficient administration of the banking system helps in the economic Growth of the nation. Banking is useful to trade and commerce. With the help of this project we aim to understand the industrial implementation of Coding, learn problem solving and effective collaboration with colleagues.

As per the project guidelines we intend to use C++ as the programming language.

## ABSTRACT

Our project is a modern age bank management system which allows its users to create and access their bank accounts efficiently without any extra effort. 

It is based on relevant technologies. The main aim of this project is to develop software for a bank management system.This project has been developed to carry out the processes easily and quickly, which is not possible with manual systems, which are overcome by this software. 

This project is developed using C++ Language. Hence, it provides the complete solution for the current management system. 

## AIM OF THE PROJECT

1. Smooth creation and deletion of bank accounts. 
2. Easy to use interface.  
3. Easy availability of loans with low interest rates.
4. Anywhere banking with high limits.
5. Access to privileged banking zones.
6. Hassle free banking

## TOPICS / FUNCTIONS USED

1. Switch Case 
2. Conditional Statements 
3. Arrays
4. Strings 
5. Comments 
6. Operators
7. Go To Statements 
8. Recursion
9. Structures 
10. Classes

## LIMITATIONS OF THE PROJECT

1. We didn’t check if the number or the address inputted by the user was accurate or met the requirements.
2. We were unable to format the table of users properly .
3. The interest calculation was not working.

## CONCLUSION

It is evident that this system is a helpful tool for managing the transactions and operations of a bank after completing the Bank Management System project using the C++ programming language. The system allows users to open up accounts, make deposits and withdrawals, and monitor the balances of their accounts, among other things. This project demonstrates the C++ language's strength, adaptability, and ability to handle challenging jobs in a straightforward and effective manner. Overall, the implementation of the Bank Management System using C++ was successful, and it is anticipated that it will be an effective management tool for banks.
